Localization using Multiple Sensors
README for PC code
===================

Files:
---
1. localization.py - Python script containing localization code
2. sample_data - File containing the sample data used to train the localization system.

Format:
---
1. localization.py
	*The code has been well commented.
2. sample_data
	*A reading is a line of values.
	*3 readings have been taken for each label (or co-ordinate).
	*The 3 readings are consecutive.
	*Thus the readings to label map is as follows. The 1st three readings are for label 0, the next 3 readings are for label 1, etc.
	*Each reading has 3 columns, one for each router. Thus the 1st column is for router ERTS_1, the next is for router ERTS_2, and the last one is for router ERTS_3.

How to run this code on the PC:
---
1. Install the needed softwares as given in the screencast video.
2. Run localization.py as follows.
	*On Windows - Open the file in IDLE and press F5.
	*On Linux - Open the terminal. Go to the folder containing this file and run `python localization.py`.
